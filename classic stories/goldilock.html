            <h1>Goldilocks and the Three Bears </h1>
            <img src="../images/classic/goldilocks.webp" alt="" width="700px" height="400px">
            <p>Once upon a time, curious little Goldilocks wandered into the woods and found a cozy cottage. Inside, she
                discovered three bowls of porridge. She tasted each one until she found the one that was just right.
                Feeling tired, she tried three chairs, breaking the smallest one, and then tested three beds, falling
                asleep in the coziest. But the cottage belonged to three bears—Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear—who
                soon returned home. They found their porridge tasted, chairs sat in, and Baby Bear’s bed occupied!
                Startled awake, Goldilocks fled, never to return to the bears' house again. </p>
            <h2>Goldilocks Enters the Cottage</h2>
            <img src="../images/classic/goldi locks1.webp" alt="" width="700px" height="400px">

            <p> Goldilocks, a curious little girl with golden curls, wanders through the forest and stumbles upon a
                quaint
                cottage. Feeling tired and hungry, she peeks inside and finds the door slightly open. The cozy room is
                filled with the smell of freshly made porridge. On the table, she sees three bowls: one big, one medium,
                and
                one small. Tempted by the delicious aroma, she decides to taste each bowl. The first is too hot, the
                second
                too cold, but the third is just right, and she eats it all up.</p>
            <h2> Goldilocks Tries the Chairs and Beds</h2>
            <img src="../images/classic/goldilocks2.webp" alt="" width="700px" height="400px">

            <p>After finishing the porridge, Goldilocks feels sleepy. She notices three chairs: a big one, a medium one,
                and a small one. She tries the big chair but finds it too hard, the medium chair is too soft, and the
                small
                chair is just right – but it breaks under her weight. Feeling even more tired, she heads to the bedroom
                and
                finds three beds. The first is too hard, the second too soft, but the third is just right. She snuggles
                in
                and falls asleep.</p>
            <h2>The Bears Return Home</h2>
            <img src="../images/classic/goldilock 3.webp" alt="" width="700px" height="400px">

            <p> The three bears – Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear – return home after their walk. They immediately
                notice something is wrong. Papa Bear grumbles, “Someone's been eating my porridge,” Mama Bear exclaims,
                “Someone's been eating my porridge,” and Baby Bear cries, “Someone’s eaten all my porridge!” They move
                to
                the living room and see their chairs have been used, with Baby Bear’s chair broken to pieces. Finally,
                they
                go to the bedroom, where Baby Bear finds Goldilocks sleeping in his bed. She wakes up to see the three
                bears
                staring at her in surprise. Frightened, she jumps up and runs out of the cottage, never to return</p>
            <p>
            <h3>Lesson and Moral of Goldilocks and the Three Bears</h3>
            <b> Respecting Others' Property:</b>
            Goldilocks enters the bears' house without permission and uses their belongings. The story teaches
            children the importance of respecting others' property and understanding boundaries.

            <b> Consequences of One's Actions:</b>
            Goldilocks faces consequences for her actions – she breaks Baby Bear's chair, eats his porridge, and
            gets caught sleeping in his bed. This shows that actions have consequences, teaching accountability and
            responsibility.

            <b> Honesty and Apologizing:</b>
            Although Goldilocks runs away at the end, the story can be a lesson about the importance of honesty and
            apologizing when mistakes are made. It opens a conversation about making amends and learning from
            wrongdoings.

            <b> Respect for Privacy and Safety:</b>
            The story illustrates the potential dangers of entering unfamiliar places. It teaches children about
            respecting others' privacy and prioritizing personal safety.

            <b>Consideration and Empathy:</b>
            By experiencing the discomfort of items that weren't hers (too hot, too cold, too big, too small),
            Goldilocks learns about considering others' feelings and needs, promoting empathy and thoughtfulness.
