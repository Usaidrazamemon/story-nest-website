            <h1>The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter</h1>
            <img src="../images/classic/rabbit.webp" alt="" width=" 700px" height="400px">
            <p>In The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter, mischievous Peter Rabbit ignores his mother’s warning and
                sneaks into Mr. McGregor’s garden. There, he feasts on delicious vegetables but soon gets into trouble
                when Mr. McGregor spots him. A frantic chase begins as Peter struggles to escape, losing his shoes and
                jacket along the way. Exhausted and scared, he finally finds his way out and returns home. His mother
                scolds him for his disobedience and, while his siblings enjoy a hearty supper, Peter goes to bed feeling
                sick from his misadventures and only gets chamomile tea.</p>
            <h2> Peter Enters Mr. McGregor's Garden</h2>
            <img src="../images/classic/rabbit 1.webp" alt="" width=" 700px" height="400px">
            <p>Once upon a time, there were four little rabbits – Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter. Their mother
                warned them never to go into Mr. McGregor's garden because their father had an accident there. However,
                naughty Peter disobeyed and slipped under the gate into the garden. He was excited by the delicious
                vegetables and began to eat lettuces, French beans, and radishes. But suddenly, Mr. McGregor spotted him
                and chased after him, waving a rake and shouting, “Stop thief!” Peter was terrified and ran around the
                garden, losing his shoes and jacket along the way.

            <h2>Peter Gets Lost and Escapes</h2>
            <img src="../images/classic/rabbit 2.webp" alt="" width=" 700px" height="400px">
            <p>Peter tried to find his way out but got lost among the cabbages. He encountered a cat, who watched him
                curiously, but Peter wisely avoided her. Frightened, he hid in a watering can but soon had to leave as
                it was full of water. Mr. McGregor almost caught him several times, but Peter managed to slip away each
                time. Finally, he found the gate and squeezed under it, escaping from the angry gardener. He ran all the
                way home, exhausted and frightened.</p>
            <h2> Peter Returns Home</h2>
            <p>Back home, Peter was tired and sick from eating too much in the garden. His mother put him to bed and
                gave him chamomile tea, while his sisters – Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail – enjoyed a lovely supper of
                bread, milk, and blackberries. Peter learned his lesson about disobedience and danger but went to bed
                without any supper.

                <b>Obedience and Listening to Parents:</b>
                Peter Rabbit gets into trouble because he disobeys his mother's warning about staying away from Mr.
                McGregor's garden. The story teaches children the importance of listening to parents and elders, who
                give advice to keep them safe.

                <b> Consequences of Actions:</b>
                Peter faces several consequences for his disobedience – he loses his shoes and jacket, is chased by Mr.
                McGregor, and goes to bed without supper. This shows that actions have consequences, and making poor
                choices can lead to difficulties.

                <b> Courage and Quick Thinking:</b>
                Despite his fear and the dangerous situation, Peter finds a way to escape. This teaches children about
                courage, quick thinking, and perseverance when facing challenges.

                <b> Learning from Mistakes:</b>
                In the end, Peter is safe but learns a valuable lesson about the consequences of misbehavior. It
                encourages children to learn from their mistakes and make better choices in the future.
