            <h1> Little Red Riding Hood</h1>
            <img src="../images/classic/red riding hood.webp" alt="" width="700px" height="400px">
            <p> Once upon a time, in a small village by the edge of a vast forest, lived a cheerful girl known as Little
                Red Riding Hood. One day, her mother asked her to bring a basket of food to her sick grandmother. “Stay
                on the path and don’t talk to strangers,” her mother warned.

                Red Riding Hood set off through the forest, humming happily and admiring the wildflowers along the way.
            </p>
            <h2>Forest Path</h2>
            <img src="../images/classic/riding hood 1.webp" alt="" width="700px" height="400px">
            <p>Suddenly, a cunning wolf appeared. “Where are you going, little girl?” he asked with a sly smile.
                “To my grandmother’s house,” she replied innocently. The wolf’s eyes gleamed as he hatched a wicked
                plan. He suggested she pick some flowers for her grandmother and, while she was distracted, he raced
                ahead to Grandma’s cottage.

                At the cottage, the wolf swallowed Grandma whole and disguised himself in her nightgown, lying in wait.

                When Red Riding Hood arrived, she noticed something strange. “Grandmother, what big eyes you have!”
                “All the better to see you with,” the wolf said.
                “And what big ears you have!”
                “All the better to hear you with.”
                “But Grandmother, what big teeth you have!”
                “All the better to EAT YOU WITH!” the wolf roared, jumping out of bed.

            </p>
            <h2>Wolf Revealed</h2>

            <p>Just then, a passing woodcutter heard Red Riding Hood’s screams. He burst into the cottage and defeated
                the wolf, freeing Grandma from his belly.
                Red Riding Hood hugged her grandmother tightly, grateful they were safe. She learned an important lesson
                about listening to her mother and never straying from the path.

            </p>
            <h2>Happy Reunion</h2> <img src="../images/classic/red riding hood 3.webp" alt="" width="700px"
                height="400px">
            <p>Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother hugged tightly, tears of relief in their eyes. The cozy
                cottage was filled with warmth and love as they realized how close they had come to danger. The brave
                woodcutter stood nearby, smiling kindly, his axe resting by his side. Grateful for his courage, they
                invited him to share the treats Red Riding Hood had brought. Laughter and joy filled the room, and they
                celebrated their safety and the power of love. </p>
           <h3>Lesson and Moral of Little Red Riding Hood</h3>
            <p> <b>Obeying Parents and Following Instructions:</b>
            Little Red Riding Hood's mother warns her to stay on the path and not talk to strangers. By disobeying, she
            encounters the wolf and ends up in danger. The story teaches children the importance of listening to parents
            and following safety rules.

           <b>Stranger Danger:</b> 
            The tale highlights the danger of trusting strangers. Red Riding Hood naively talks to the wolf, which leads
            to trouble. It teaches children to be cautious and not trust unfamiliar people too easily.

         <b>   Consequences of Distraction:</b>
            By straying from the path to pick flowers, Red Riding Hood loses time and unknowingly gives the wolf a
            chance to reach her grandmother's house first. The story illustrates that distractions can lead to
            unintended consequences.

            <b>Bravery and Rescue:</b>
            In some versions, a woodsman saves Red Riding Hood and her grandmother, teaching that courage and help from
            others can overcome danger. It also shows the importance of community and protecting loved ones.

           <b>Learning from Mistakes:</b>
            At the end of the story, Red Riding Hood realizes her mistakes and learns to be more careful in the future.
            This encourages children to learn from their experiences and make better choices.</p>
