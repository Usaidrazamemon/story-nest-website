            <h1> The Three Little Pigs</h1>
            <p> Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who lived with their mother. One day, they decided to
                leave
                home and build houses of their own. Their mother warned them, "Whatever you do, do it the best you can,
                because that's the way to</h3> get along in the world </p>
            <h2>The Straw House</h2>
            <img src="../images/classic/three pig 1.webp" alt="three little pig" width="700px" height="400px">

            <p> The first little pig was lazy. He quickly built his house out of straw to have more time to play. He
                finished in no time and danced around his flimsy house, laughing, "Now the wolf won't catch me!" </p>

            <p> But soon, the Big Bad Wolf came knocking at the door. He growled, "Little pig, little pig, let me come
                in!"
                The pig replied, "Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin!"
                "Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in!" the wolf roared. He took a deep breath and
                blew down the straw house with ease. The first little pig ran as fast as he could to his brother's house
            </p>.

            <h2>The Stick House</h2>
            <img src="../images/classic/three pig 2.webp" alt="three little pig" width="700px" height="400px">

            <p> The second little pig, somewhat lazy but a bit more cautious, built his house out of sticks. It was a
                little
                stronger than straw but still quite weak. Just as he finished, his brother arrived, gasping, "The wolf
                blew
                my house down! Let me in!"
                The second pig let him in and bolted the door. </p>

            <p> Soon, the wolf appeared, growling, "Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in!"
                "Not by the hair of our chinny-chin-chins!" the pigs shouted.
                "Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in!" The wolf huffed and puffed and blew down
                the
                stick house. Both pigs ran as fast as they could to their brother's brick house. </p>

            <h2>The Brick House</h2>
            <img src="../images/classic/three pig 3.webp" alt="three little pig" width="700px" height="400px">
            <p> The third little pig was hardworking and wise. He had built his house out of bricks, the strongest
                material.
                His brothers rushed inside, slamming the door just as the wolf arrived.
                The wolf growled, "Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in!"
                "Not by the hair of our chinny-chin-chins!" they cried.
                "Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in!" The wolf huffed and puffed, but no matter
                how
                hard he tried, the brick house stood firm. He grew tired and furious. </p>

            <p> Determined to get in, the wolf climbed up to the roof and prepared to slide down the chimney. But the
                clever
                third pig had anticipated this. He quickly lit a roaring fire in the fireplace and placed a pot of
                boiling
                water on it. </p>

            <p> The wolf slid down the chimney and SPLASH! He landed in the boiling water with a howl of pain. He leaped
                up
                the chimney and ran away, never to bother the three little pigs again. </p>

            <h3>The Lesson</h3>
            <p> The three little pigs danced with joy. The first and second pigs realized the value of hard work and
                promised to be more like their wise brother. They all lived happily ever after in the strong, cozy brick
                house. </p>

            <p><b> Moral of the Story:</b> Hard work and perseverance pay off, and shortcuts can lead to trouble.
